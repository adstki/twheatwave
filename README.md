# Python 'Twheatwave' Program 

## **Description**

Exposure to extreme heat causes thousands of deaths every year. In June 2023, a massive heatwave crippled the United States where temperatures exceeded 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Consequently, health emergencies were declared in the country's Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions. While the geographic mechanism of heatwaves is understood by scientists, its social impact is not adequately measured and studied due to a lack of data. 

Using the powerful X (Twitter) API, the *Twheatwave Program* scrapes X's (tweets) using keyword searches related to the 2023 heatwave (“US heatwave”, "heat", etc.) and unravel the sentiments expressed by users. Visualizations of these sentiments are displayed based on location and highlight regions with the most pressing need for heat mitigation resources.
